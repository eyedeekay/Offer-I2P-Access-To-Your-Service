How to offer your existing Web Site as an I2P eepSite
=====================================================

This blog post is intended as a general guide to running a mirror of a clear-net
service as an eepSite.

Unfortunately, it's probably impossible to *completely* cover all possible cases
of making an existing web site available as an eepSite, there's simply too
diverse an array of server-side software, not to mention the in-practice
peculiarities of any particular deployment of software. Instead, I'm going to
try and convey, as specifically as possible, the general process preparing a
service for deployment to the eepWeb or other hidden services.

Much of this guide will be treating the reader as a conversational participant,
in particular If I really mean it I will address the reader directly(i.e. using
"you" instead of "one") and I'll frequently head sections with questions I think
the reader might be asking. This is, after all, a "process" that an
administrator must consider themselves "involved" in just like hosting any other
service.
