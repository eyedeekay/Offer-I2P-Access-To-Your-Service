DISCLAIMERS:
------------

While it would be wonderful, it's probably impossible for me to put specific
instructions for every single kind of software that one might use to host web
sites. As such, this tutorial requires some assumptions on the part of the
writer and some critical thinking and common sense on the part of the reader.
To be clear, **I have assumed that the person following this tutorial is**
**already operating a clear-web service linkable to a real identity or**
**organization** and thus is simply offering anonymous access and not
anonymizing themselves. Thus, **it makes no attempt whatsoever to anonymize**
a connection from one server to another. If you want to run a new, un-linkable
hidden service that makes server-to-server connections, additional steps will
be required and will be covered in another tutorial.

That said: If you can be sure that a *brand new service* which is *not*
*available to the clear-web* will never make a server-to-server connection and
will not leak server metadata in responses to clients, then services configured
in this way will be anonymous.
